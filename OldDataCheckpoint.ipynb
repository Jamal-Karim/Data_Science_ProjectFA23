    "Background: The National Football League (NFL) is a professional league where all the best American football players compete. The league spans all of the United States and is divided up into 32 teams. In this data analysis we examine how much of an impact home field advantage applies to the home team winning the game, if at all. We also analyze by what margin of victory or loss the home team exhibits. Home field advantage is a common concept amongst all sports where some fans believe that the home team gains many advantages. One of the factors is not having to travel long distances for games the night or two nights before and being familiar with your home atmosphere. Another factor is the support and amount of fans. An example of this being relevant could be: when on the offensive side of the ball, fans lower their voices so the players can hear their coaches and leaders on the field, and in the same respect, when the home team is on defense, the fans raise their voices and become extremely loud so the visiting team can’t enjoy those luxuries. A side product of the fans also may impact the referees as they are pressured into doing what the home fans want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior Work: One piece of work looked at the value being home field advantage and predicting its effectiveness for the 2023 season. The study found that home field advantage in recent years has been trending downward. The base advantage that home field offers is usually 3 points but the study predicted it to go down to 1.4 for the 2023 season. https://www.covers.com/nfl/home-field-advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "Another piece of work looked at why home field advantage hasn’t been as effective as it used to be. The two main factors that this study examined were travel and the fans. Travel takes a huge toll on players both physically and mentally, but with new leaps of medicine, players have been able to reduce the effect travel has on their bodies. The study also found that fans had a significant impact on the players. While positive energy from the home team did help players, the study also mentioned that players would be too worried about letting down the fans that they end up costing themselves the win. According to this study, fans also had an effect through referees, who would more often make calls in favor of the home team. However, because of recent rule changes such as the ability to review calls, this effect has decreased. https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/why-the-home-field-advantage-is-on-the-decline\n",
    "\n",
    "A third piece of work examined home-field advantage but from a view of individual NFL teams. It considers some confounding variables like weather, noise, and time zone. It also cites specific teams’ records and argues that certain teams actually do have a home field advantage, and that others do not necessarily have one. Some reasons that they thought could explain these advantages were that certain teams adapted more easily, time zone travel could hurt West coast teams, traction on the fields, and more. https://www.the33rdteam.com/category/analysis/which-nfl-teams-actually-have-home-field-advantage/ \n"

    "- We came to this hypothesis because we believe that familiarity with the home conditions and stadium could improve performance. Also, more fans could attend home games, elevating the morale of the home team in significant ways. We chose 5 because we think that the home team could be improved by almost a touchdown (6 points)."

The dataset comes from the Github of nfl verse which is a collection of data and R packages for NFL analytics. There’s about 5,000 observations where each observation represents a game between two teams.

    "Although the concept of home team advantage is relevant across sports and skill levels, we decided to study the highly visible NFL to get the most comprehensive, most reputable, and least biased data possible. There are few privacy or terms of use issues present in our proposed data because the data of NFL matches and players are publicly available. However, in the second dataset, people did not necessarily know that their attendance was being recorded, but their attendance is not attached to any identifying information so this should not be a major ethical issue. A potential unintended consequence is that if it becomes common knowledge that there is a definitive/significant home-field advantage effect, teams could also try to exploit this. A potential bias in our first dataset is that it includes neutral games where neither team had home-field advantage; this could be irrelevant or distracting to our question, so we plan to remove these observations from the data. Additionally, there may be some sources of bias for home-team advantage within NFL data due to home stadiums being different sizes, containing different mixes of home/visiting fans, and other metrics that are difficult to measure and/or account for. In terms of equitable impact, the impact of our analysis could be potentially limited because of the significant differences/biases between NFL matches and matches in other sports/leagues, so it is unlikely that our results could directly be applied to those other populations. We can deal with detecting specific biases before analysis by choosing broad datasets that include every game and stat possible. We can detect specific biases during and after analysis by checking the data for outliers, unexpected patterns, and confounding variables that demonstrate the presence of significant bias and then addressing those issues as they arise. We addressed other potential bias issues by targeting data sources that contain comprehensive match results (they leave nothing out for the season they were played in), unaffiliated with a specific team or stadium.\n"
