    "Background: The National Football League (NFL) is a professional league where all the best American football players compete. The league spans all of the United States and is divided up into 32 teams. In this data analysis we examine how much of an impact home field advantage applies to the home team winning the game, if at all. We also analyze by what margin of victory or loss the home team exhibits. Home field advantage is a common concept amongst all sports where some fans believe that the home team gains many advantages. One of the factors is not having to travel long distances for games the night or two nights before and being familiar with your home atmosphere. Another factor is the support and amount of fans. An example of this being relevant could be: when on the offensive side of the ball, fans lower their voices so the players can hear their coaches and leaders on the field, and in the same respect, when the home team is on defense, the fans raise their voices and become extremely loud so the visiting team can’t enjoy those luxuries. A side product of the fans also may impact the referees as they are pressured into doing what the home fans want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior Work: One piece of work looked at the value being home field advantage and predicting its effectiveness for the 2023 season. The study found that home field advantage in recent years has been trending downward. The base advantage that home field offers is usually 3 points but the study predicted it to go down to 1.4 for the 2023 season. https://www.covers.com/nfl/home-field-advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "Another piece of work looked at why home field advantage hasn’t been as effective as it used to be. The two main factors that this study examined were travel and the fans. Travel takes a huge toll on players both physically and mentally, but with new leaps of medicine, players have been able to reduce the effect travel has on their bodies. The study also found that fans had a significant impact on the players. While positive energy from the home team did help players, the study also mentioned that players would be too worried about letting down the fans that they end up costing themselves the win. According to this study, fans also had an effect through referees, who would more often make calls in favor of the home team. However, because of recent rule changes such as the ability to review calls, this effect has decreased. https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/why-the-home-field-advantage-is-on-the-decline\n",
    "\n",
    "A third piece of work examined home-field advantage but from a view of individual NFL teams. It considers some confounding variables like weather, noise, and time zone. It also cites specific teams’ records and argues that certain teams actually do have a home field advantage, and that others do not necessarily have one. Some reasons that they thought could explain these advantages were that certain teams adapted more easily, time zone travel could hurt West coast teams, traction on the fields, and more. https://www.the33rdteam.com/category/analysis/which-nfl-teams-actually-have-home-field-advantage/ \n"

    "- We came to this hypothesis because we believe that familiarity with the home conditions and stadium could improve performance. Also, more fans could attend home games, elevating the morale of the home team in significant ways. We chose 5 because we think that the home team could be improved by almost a touchdown (6 points)."

The dataset comes from the Github of nfl verse which is a collection of data and R packages for NFL analytics. There’s about 5,000 observations where each observation represents a game between two teams. Potentially, we want to find another dataset to explore other potential environmental factors; for example, a dataset that describes the type of stadium (open/closed) that we can merge into the dataset that we already have. \n",

    "The question of home team advantage is relevant across sports and skill levels, but in order to get the most comprehensive, reputable, and unbiased data possible we decided to study the highly-visible NFL. Due to the significant differences/biases between NFL matches and matches in other sports/leagues, it is unlikely that our results could directly be applied to those other populations. Also, it is possible that there are some sources of bias for home-team advantage within NFL data due to home stadiums being different sizes, containing different mixes of home/visiting fans, and other metrics that are difficult to measure and/or account for. We can handle these issues by checking the data for outliers, unexpected patterns, and confounding variables that demonstrate the presence of significant bias and then addressing those issues as they arise. We don’t believe our research question has any significant ethical concerns, for any finding would not unfairly help/harm any particular team.\n",

We seek to avoid bias in our selection of data to use by targeting data sources that contain comprehensive match results (they leave nothing out for the season they were played in), avoiding datasets that are biased as a result of them containing limited variety of entries or omitting a significant portion of the season.\n"
